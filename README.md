Enable HiDPI on OS X
====================================

2016-3-3

－ You can use the enable-HiDPI.sh directly to fully enable HiDPI on your OS X.

－ Note: This is the first version of enable-HiDPI, I just tested it on 10.11.3, more function will be added late. If you find bugs please let me know through the "Issuses" tab.
